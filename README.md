# UnderMine-Tools
UnderMine save files editor with auto backup function.

[Update]
To download just the compiled version, get this file: http://www.mediafire.com/file/csawk2o5ltm1l32/UnderMine_Tools_2020_10_09.zip/file

[WARNING] Due to some errors while trying to upload the updated project (it almost always give me errors on the ".resources" files usually), so now it's incomplete... please just use the link above for now, sorry. In a week I'll try to fix it again.

Now it can give from 0 to 2 familiars at once, quickly load and save any peasant, including changes of sex, name and colors, and lots of new features like a zone teleporter even for infinite runs, and without mods.

[How to start]
With the source code comes a full compiled version under "..\UnderMine-Tools\UnderMine Tools\bin\Debug\UnderMine Tools.exe" just extract the zip and start this executable. It should auto detect your save files, then just select the one to edit, change the settings you want and click the bottom left big button that says "make a backup and save the changes...". The start UnderMine and test all the things you have selected and have fun.

[Description]
Basically you can select waht items, gold, relics, curses, etc to have in game. Also now you can customize your peasant (it has options for sex, and hair, skin, eyes and clothes colors). It has a preview in real time. And it can give you up to 2 familiars at once. And even supports blessings up to level 2.147.483.647, but I only use up to 999. It can also give the rock effects for fire and shock of infinite duration.
 
 [Development status]
 Current status: almost learned the IDs (Guids) for all the status effects (curses, potion effects, relics, crystals, demon relics, etc). And almost all the IDs for familiars and potion bottles. So the tool is almost completed at this point for a first version.
 
 [Automatic backup]
 It works by always making a full backup of the save file it's going to edit, so only if it succeeds it will continue. This way your saves will never be lost. I mostly used this tool to try all the relics at once with all the blessings also at level 999, which gives more than 40.000 of life (it can give you up to several millions if you want). So basically is a very good and quick way to test more the game and discover the best combinations of relics, etc. Or just to feel overpowered and have fun for a while.

[Tips I learned by playing]

- At the start of each new level the game says "Autosaving", which means that after the message is gone you can quit the game to it's main menu without fully closing it and edit your desired save game with this application, and even fully delete the saves folder to then add any backup you want. This trick saved me a lot of time while making this tool and doing tests.

- There is a potion that spawns a random chest. These chests can be "blue", which gives thorium and new blueprints for blessings, potions or relics, so giving yourself 4 chest potions at the start of each level with this tool is the quickest way to unlock everything in game (aside from fully cheating). And the game saves at the start of each level, so this means that if after spawning the 4 chests none of them was blue, you can quit and reload the same save to try again with the 4 potions without even editing again your save. But just remember to finish the level so the next autosaving can occur or your new discoveries will be lost forever. The chests can also be "green" with a lot of gold, "purple" with a random curse each time (useful for unlocking new curses) or "brown" (with or without a lock) with just regular stuff and random potions.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day :-)
